[Lola](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/lola) is a character who has to pick up items and activate shrines indirectly. Breaking normal low% rules results in death, while items may be collected by leaving them out.

There are some [nuances](./Nuance.md) to those rules that one may wish to read, as well as some [strategy and hints](./Strategy%20and%20hints.md). Additionally, like other Nixill mods, there are [Options](./Options.md) that the player may change.

<!-- Coding a mod alongside Lola? You may be interested in reading about the [modules](./dev/modules/README.md), [components](./dev/Components.md), or [entities](./dev/Entities.md) that the mod provides. -->

This documentation is up-to-date with version 1.1.0 of Lola.

It's [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Lola)! You can [report problems or suggest features](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Lola/issues) there too.
