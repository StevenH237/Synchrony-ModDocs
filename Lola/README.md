Lola is a character who has to pick up items and activate shrines indirectly. Breaking normal low% rules results in death, while items may be collected by leaving them out.

There are some [nuances](Nuance.md) to those rules that one may wish to read.

This documentation is up-to-date with version 1.0.3 of Lola, which is not yet public.

It's [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Lola)! You can [report problems or suggest features](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Lola/issues) there too.
