This page goes over some of the finer details of Lola's two rules.

# Low% rules apply
Lola will instantly die if they directly attempt to pick up any item or use any shrine.

Except:
- If Lola drops or throws an item, they may retrieve it without dying.
- If Lola breaks a Glass Shovel or a Glass weapon, they may pick up its shard without dying.
- Lola may cause the Shrines of Fire, Pain, Sacrifice, and the Feast to become activated (though picking up the rewards is still deadly).
- Like any other (vanilla, at least) character, Lola may pick up The Golden Lute.

Items that are safe for Lola to directly pick up are outlined in blue.

# Revealed items are collected on stairs

This means that Lola will get to keep any items they reveal (from a crate, chest, etc.) as long as the items are still on the ground at the end of the floor.

An item can count as revealed if it comes from...
- A chest
- A crate or barrel
- A shrine
- Any shopkeeper (the reward for killing them)
- Leprechaun or Thief
- A chest, crate, barrel, or shrine Mimic
- The peaceful gargoyles in zone 4

The above are collectively known as "item storages", at least when they are actually holding an item.

When an item storage is opened, the last player that interacted with it claims the item (though that only has any effect for Lola). The following count as interacting with a storage:
- Opening chests
- Bumping shrines (note: this is usually deadly for Lola!)
- Attacking crates (including *your own* bombs and spells, whether or not the attack opens the crate)

Environmental damage (wall spikes, bomb traps, Dragon fire, etc.) does not count as a player interaction.

Only items capable of breaking low% can be claimed.

Items get unclaimed if any player picks them up or they get packaged.
