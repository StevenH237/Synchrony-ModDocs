This page goes over some of the finer details of Lola's two rules.

# Low% rules apply
Lola will instantly die if she directly attempts to pick up any item or use any shrine.

Except:
- If Lola drops or throws an item, she may retrieve it without dying.
- If Lola breaks a Glass Shovel or a Glass weapon, she may pick up its shard without dying.
- Lola may cause the Shrines of Fire, Pain, Sacrifice, and the Feast to become activated (though picking up the rewards is still deadly).
  - Note that this doesn't break low% for other characters either!
- Like any other character, Lola may pick up The Golden Lute.

Items that are safe for Lola to directly pick up are outlined in blue.

# Revealed items are collected on stairs

This means that Lola will get to keep any items she reveals (from a crate, chest, etc) as long as they're still on the ground.
