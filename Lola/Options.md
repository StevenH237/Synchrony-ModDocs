The following options are available to players:

# Presets
Lola comes with two presets that you can select by going to the mod's options and selecting "Use a preset":

## Default rules
This is Lola's default rules.

## Classic rules
These rules more closely resemble the state of the mod when Nix got their first testing clear:
- Lola does not have chest sight.
- Lola does not have Package spell.
- Lola starts with three bombs instead of one.
- Lola cannot pick up shards of broken glass weapons or shovels.
- Lola cannot receive rewards from indirectly-activated shrines.
- Lola cannot receive purchases made at a conjurer or transmogrifier.

# Gameplay settings
## Package spell
This controls whether or not Lola has the Package Spell, with the following options:
- **None:** Lola does not have Package Spell. *(Default for Classic Rules)*
- **Replaceable:** Lola starts with Package Spell, but may lose it.
- **Innate:** Lola starts with Package Spell, and cannot lose it. *(Default.)*

## Starting bombs
The number of bombs Lola starts with, which may be 0 to 5 or (on the left) Infinite. *(Defaults to 1, or 3 for Classic Rules.)*

## Chest vision
If on, Lola is able to innately see the locations of chests, shrines, crates, mimics, shopkeepers, and other item holders. (But not their contents.) *(Defaults to on, or off for Classic Rules.)*

## Allow picking up glass shards
If on, Lola may pick up the shards of glass weapons and shovels that they had held before they broke. *(Defaults to on, or off for Classic Rules.)*

## Receive shrine rewards
Lola may activate Sacrifice, Pain, Fireball, and Feast shrines without dying (regardless of this setting's value).

If this setting is enabled, Lola will receive the rewards from activating those shrines as part of their normal stair item collection. *(Defaults to on, or off for Classic Rules.)*

## Receive tile purchases
If on, Lola will receive items spawned by Conjurer and Transmogrifier transaction tiles as part of their normal stair item collection. *(Defaults to on, or off for Classic Rules.)*

# Silly settings
## Greater Package enemies
If on, when Lola uses Greater Package Spell facing an enemy, that enemy will be crated. This can unlock stairs if it's a miniboss or boss (but, in the latter case, does not despawn the boss's adds!). *(Defaults to off.)*

## Lute mode
As Nixill's favorite vanilla character is Melody, enabling this ruleset weaponlocks Lola to the Golden Lute, allowing a combination of Melody and Lola gameplay. *(Defaults to off.)*
