PowerSettings is a library mod that I'm making to add a few extra settings types and capabilities on top of Synchrony's existing settings API.

For players: There isn't much you need to know about PowerSettings. You should try to look for help from the mod that brought you here. [Switcheroo](../Switcheroo/README.md) and Character Rules both use this mod, for example.

For developers: There are a couple quickstart guides available, as follows.

The first two parts assume you haven't used Synchrony's settings API yet, and explain that.

1. [Synchrony settings tutorial part 1](tutorial/GettingStarted-1.md)
2. [Synchrony settings tutorial part 2](tutorial/GettingStarted-2.md)

Click [here](Conversion.md) if you're already using Synchrony's built-in settings API (the `necro.config.Settings` module) or [here](GettingStarted-1.md) if you're not.

(This documentation is up-to-date with release 2.4.0 of PowerSettings.)
