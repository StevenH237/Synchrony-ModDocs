[Switcheroo](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/Switcheroo) is a mod that randomizes the player's build every floor.

It has various [options](Options.md) that can control how many items are given, when, and what. If you're using "Show advanced options" (in NecroDancer's config), you can show [more options](Options-Advanced.md).

Developers wishing to code with Switcheroo may wish to look at [modules](dev/Modules.md), [components](dev/Components.md), [entities](dev/Entities.md), or [setting nodes](dev/Settings.md).

It's [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Switcheroo)! You can [report problems or suggest features](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Switcheroo/issues) there too.
