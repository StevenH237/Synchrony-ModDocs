# Switcheroo
[Switcheroo](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/Switcheroo) is a mod that randomizes the player's build every floor.

It has various [options](Switcheroo/Options.md) that can control how many items are given, when, and what.

It also has some [modules](Switcheroo/dev/Modules.md), [components](Switcheroo/dev/Components.md), and [entities](Switcheroo/dev/Entities.md) that may be worth looking into.

It's [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Switcheroo)! You can [report problems or suggest features](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Switcheroo/issues/new) there too.

(Because I know I'm going to forget: This documentation is up-to-date with version 3.2.2 of Synchrony.)
