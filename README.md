This is a central help guide for Nixill's Synchrony Mods.

# How to reach Nixill
The best way to reach me about my mods is to ping @Nixill#1370 in the `#mod-general` chat of [the Synchrony discord](https://discord.gg/qS88uUC9p2) (or the `#mod-help` chat if you're trying to make a mod using one of the libraries I've made).

# MenuMod
MenuMod is an upcoming library mod! I'm making it to make mods presenting their own menus to players easier.
