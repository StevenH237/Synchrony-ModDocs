MenuMod is an upcoming library mod! I'm making it to make mods presenting their own menus to players easier.

For players: There isn't much you need to know about MenuMod. You should try to look for help from the mod that brought you here.

For developers: The [MenuMod module](dev/modules/MenuMod.md) is probably a good starting point.

For me: I should develop a quickstart guide.

(This documentation is up-to-date with release 0.0.1 of MenuMod, which is not yet public.)
