[Spatial Distortions](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/SpatialDistortions) is a mod that randomizes the order of floors within a run.

It has various [options](Options.md) that can put constraints on this ordering, as well as a user setting that can toggle the appearance of a warning indicator on the final floor.

It's [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-SpatialDistortions)! You can [report problems or suggest features](https://github.com/StevenH237/Synchrony-Switcheroo/issues) there too.

This documentation is up-to-date with version 0.0.4 of Spatial Distortions (not yet released as of this writing).
