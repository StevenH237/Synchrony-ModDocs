NixLib is a library mod I made to not have to redefine the same functions over and over again across other mods I'm making.

For players: There isn't much you need to know about NixLib. You should try to look for help from the mod that brought you here. [Switcheroo](../Switcheroo/README.md) and Character Rules both use this mod, for example.

For developers: The main module is [`NixLib.NixLib`](./modules/NixLib.md). There's also a module for small localizable strings at [`NixLib.i18n.Text`](./modules/i18n/Text.md).

(This documentation is up-to-date with release 2.2.0 of NixLib.)
